## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

Setting up Vim, Git and Terminator was very straightforward and easy:
Simply type in the "sudo apt-get install" commands for every program and the installation takes care of the rest (after possibly having to authenticate you, the user, using the system password). Afterwards, the programs are set up and ready to use!

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

Like everything, beginning to use Git was a bit of a sluggish process in which trial and error played a key role. Eventually things became clear and tutorials and other instructions for Git, the SSH key and Vim were of crucial importance. As things progressed, it became clear how useful and brilliant "forking" is when it comes to sharing and contributing to code for various software; it's like Google Docs mixed with C++ and Linux. I believe that with more practice this would become an ideal tool with which aspiring programmers, like myself, could easily contribute, track and share their code.

## 5. Unnið með Git (2. hluti)

Markdown is very user-friendly and convenient to carry out projects and assignments such as this. As document-processing goes, Markdown is very easy to use, assuming the user has a touch of programming experience, and, as John Gruber stated on "Daring Fireball", readability is emphasized above all else.

Posting pictures on a Markdown document was a bit tricky, as it was only by the helfpful assistance of a fellow classmate on Facebook that I discovered the proper procedure. The correct location of the images (on the hard drive and on GitHub) coupled with the "git add" command was not clarified anywhere else that I knew of, but, then again, I went to Facebook first before seeing if Google could help. It was a small bump on an otherwise very smooth road.
