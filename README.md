## 1. Linux uppsetning

(Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS already installed using "Dual-Boot" method, see attached photos.)

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

Setting up Vim, Git and Terminator was very straightforward and easy:
Simply type in the "sudo apt-get install" commands for every program and the installation takes care of the rest! (After possibly having to authenticate yourself using the system password.)

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

Like everything, beginning to use Git was a bit of a sluggish process in which trial and error played a key role. Eventually things became clear and tutorials and other instructions for the SSH key and Vim were of crucial importance. As things progressed, it became clear how useful and brilliant "forking" is when it comes to sharing and contributing to code for various software; it's like Google Docs mixed with C++ and Linux. I believe that with more practice this would become an ideal tool with which aspiring programmers, like myself, could easily contribute, track and share their code.
